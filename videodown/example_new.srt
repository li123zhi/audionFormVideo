1
00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:01,885
Row! Row faster!

2
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:03,225
If we can just get off this lake,

3
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:03,936
we'll be safe.

4
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:10,681
Ahhh!

5
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:11,931
Miaomiao, look out!

6
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,109
Quick, grab my hand!

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,706
It's okay now, Miaomiao.

8
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,016
Aaaaah!

9
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:36,504
Pull me up!

10
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,151
No, we can't save you.

11
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:39,528
The raft's broken.

12
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:40,776
It can't hold three.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,879
Miaomiao!

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:42,842
I'm your boyfriend!

15
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:43,874
How could you do this?

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,858
The one I've always loved is Wang Kun.

17
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,806
I even had his child.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,554
What?

19
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,987
She's right.

20
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:52,813
You stay here

21
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:54,701
and distract that monster for us.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,351
No!

23
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:58,918
You can't!

24
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,974
Don't blame me!

25
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:01,141
Every year on this date,

26
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,813
I'll burn 10 billion for you.

27
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,202
I'll burn 10 billion for you!

28
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:09,859
I even had his child.

29
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:10,476
Hahaha...

30
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:13,502
What's going on?

31
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,743
Didn't I die?

32
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:16,367
I...

33
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,259
I've been reborn

34
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,680
back to when we first arrived on the island.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,424
Hahaha!

36
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,343
Honey, you're finally awake.

37
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,386
You passed out

38
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:30,802
as soon as we got to the island.

39
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,477
That's the mouth

40
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,918
that said 'don't save him'.

41
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:36,033
No, we can't save him.

42
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:37,130
The raft's broken.

43
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,716
You must have low blood sugar.

44
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:39,936
Here, take the candy.

45
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,145
That's the hand that pushed me into the abyss.

46
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,371
Hey, hey, Kun!

47
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,311
There you are!

48
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,664
Let's go fishing in the lake.

49
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,225
Sounds good.

50
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,108
I've always heard the fish in this lake are

51
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,611
huge and easy to catch.

52
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,435
Big fish... in the lake?

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,996
Monster...

54
00:01:57,996 --> 00:01:59,340
There's a monster in the lake!
